This angular todo app was created around a year ago as an angularJS primer for my own learning. I have recently uploaded it for archival purposes.

 It is a simple angular app featuring use ofÂ controllers, simple routing, and a filter to show completed items.

It was scaffolded out using yeoman with grunt as the build automation tool. I did not write any unit tests for this particular app.
